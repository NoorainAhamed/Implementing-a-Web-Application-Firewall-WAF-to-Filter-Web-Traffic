# Implementing-a-Web-Application-Firewall-WAF-to-Filter-Web-Traffic
A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a security solution designed to protect web applications from common threats such as SQL injection,  (XSS), and  (DDoS) attacks. WAF acts as a filtering layer between users and the web application, analyzing and blocking malicious requests before they reach the backend servers.

In this project, we will implement AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) to secure a web application hosted on AWS. AWS WAF integrates with Amazon CloudFront, Application Load Balancer (ALB), and API Gateway to protect against malicious traffic.
# Objectives
•	Deploy AWS WAF to monitor and filter web traffic.
•	Protect against common security threats such as SQL Injection, XSS, and Bot Attacks.
•	Integrate AWS WAF with Application Load Balancer (ALB) to safeguard EC2 instances.
•	Configure custom rules to block unwanted traffic.
•	Set up monitoring and logging using AWS CloudWatch for analysis.
